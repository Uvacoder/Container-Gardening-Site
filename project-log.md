**Today's Progress**:
- Used flexbox to style header. Set `display:flex` on parent header element and then set `display:flex` on nav element so menu items would line up horizontally. I then adjusted the `padding-left` property on the nav menu items to get appropriate spacing.

**Thoughts**: 
- Learned about the `list-style-position` CSS property that is used for styling lists. It sets the position of the marker relative to a list (marker for unordered list = bullet(default), marker for ordered list(numbers)). You can set it to `outside` (default) and `inside`.

**Today's Progress**:
- Started working on basic HTML structure for site with incorporation of CSS flexbox for the layout
- Changed default branch from master to main

**Thoughts**: 
- I learned the importance of having to reset browser CSS styles as I was trying to figure out why I was seeing spaces between my block level elements. I'm glad I had a background color applied to them so I could see the spaces that were there due to browswer CSS properties.
