**Today's Progress**:
- Started working on basic HTML structure for site with incorporation of CSS flexbox for the layout
- Changed default branch from master to main

**Thoughts**: 
- I learned the importance of having to reset browser CSS styles as I was trying to figure out why I was seeing spaces between my block level elements. I'm glad I had a background color applied to them so I could see the spaces that were there due to browswer CSS properties.
